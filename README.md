Dishwashers are a modern machinery, reducing manual labour and conserving significant amounts of water annually. Even though they are capable of effectively cleaning a variety of dishes, they have poor efficiency in washing cups alone. In response, cup washers have emerged in the market, utilizing different cleaning mediums such as water and steam. A common limitation of existing cup washers is their inability to accommodate cups of various shapes and sizes, often tailored for specific cup types. 

Achieving such versatility can be done with steam or with compressed air in combination with water. Challenges that are addressed:
	The utilization of steam eliminates the need for detergent, owing to its inherent sterilizing properties. 
	To hold down cups of various shapes and sizes under pressure, a mechanism has been developed.
	The steam must reach all the spots inside the cup leaving no dead spots, otherwise a nozzle design is required to avoid such cases. 
	The development of a universal steam-based cup washer can significantly enhance water efficiency and sustainability in dishwashing practices.

A cup washer that uses minimal amount of water in form of steam is developed, capable of cleaning cups of various shapes and sizes. The important part of the project is the design of the cup washer that can accommodate cup of different sizes. 
The next vital part of the project is the utilisation of the steam boiler to produce steam that will be used to wash cups. In conclusion, using steam as the primary cleaning agent has resulted in a water efficient solution for cleaning cups.
